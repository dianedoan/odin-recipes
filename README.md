# Odin Recipes

This basic recipe website accessible at https://dianedoan.github.io/odin-recipes/ contains the following recipes:
- Macaroni and Cheese

Each recipe contains a photo of the completed dish, a brief description, the list of ingredients, and steps of directions to make the dish. 

## Skills demonstrated
This project demonstrates concepts learned at the end of the HTML Foundations unit in The Odin Project such as the HTML boilerplate, text elements, unordered/ordered lists, and links/images. In addition, this project also allowed me to practice using Git and terminal commands.
